# System-Monitor
System Monitor is a desktop application (dashboard) developed to display real-time information / performance data in a graphical way. 
The initial idea was to create a dashboard, which automatically collects the essential performance data instead of using the standard Windows Performance Monitor, which one can find by typing "perfmon"
at a command prompt. It is a very simple application written in C# and WPF but it exactly does what I wanted it to do. 

Additional packages I added to the project:
1. LiveCharts - charts
2. MahApps.Metro.IconPacks.Material - Icons package
